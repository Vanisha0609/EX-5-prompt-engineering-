# **Experiment 5: Comparative Analysis of Naïve Prompting versus Basic Prompting Using ChatGPT Across Various Test Scenarios**

## **Aim:**
To test how ChatGPT responds to naïve prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios, analyzing the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## **Algorithm:**

### **Define Prompt Types:**
- **Naïve Prompts:** Broad, vague, or open-ended with little specificity.  
- **Basic Prompts:** Clear, detailed, and structured prompts with specific context or instructions.

### **Prepare Test Scenarios:**
- Creative storytelling  
- Factual question answering  
- Concept summarization  
- Advice or recommendation  
- Technical explanation

### **Create Prompt Pairs:**  
Each scenario includes both a naïve and a basic prompt targeting the same task.

### **Run Experiments:**
- Input naïve prompt into ChatGPT and record output.  
- Input corresponding basic prompt and record output.

### **Evaluate Responses:**
- Assess based on quality, accuracy, and depth.  
- Determine whether basic prompts consistently yield better results.

| **Scenario**           | **Naïve Prompt**                          | **ChatGPT Response (Naïve)**                        | **Basic Prompt**                                                       | **ChatGPT Response (Basic)**                                      | **Quality**    | **Accuracy**   | **Depth**       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Creative Story         | "Tell me a story."                        | Generic tale about a dog and a boy.                 | "Write a 300-word fantasy story about a brave girl..."                | Vivid and structured fantasy story with depth.                    | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve   |
| Factual Q&A            | "Tell me about Mars."                     | General, surface-level facts.                       | "List five key facts about Mars’ atmosphere..."                       | Concise, fact-rich response with specific information.            | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve   |
| Concept Summarization  | "Summarize photosynthesis."               | Overly simplified summary.                          | "Summarize the process of photosynthesis in 3-4 lines..."             | Clear, level-appropriate summary.                                 | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve   |
| Advice/Recommendation  | "Give me some advice."                    | Generic life advice.                                | "Give 3 tips for college students to stay productive..."              | Practical and contextual recommendations.                         | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve  | Basic > Naïve   |

---

## **Analysis:**
- Basic prompts consistently resulted in responses that were better in all three dimensions: **quality**, **accuracy**, and **depth**.
- Naïve prompts produced vague and less useful responses.
- **Prompt clarity plays a crucial role** in guiding the model to generate more structured and relevant content.

---

## **Conclusion:**
- Clear, specific, and structured prompts lead to significantly improved outputs when using ChatGPT.
- Users should invest time in refining prompts for optimal AI-generated results.
- There were **no test cases** where naïve prompts matched or outperformed basic prompts.

## **Result:**
The prompt for the above-said problem **executed successfully**.
